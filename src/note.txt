    - copy all files from all subdirectories into ./songs/{file}
    - copy all files into ./d"songs"/d"{album_name}"/f"{song_title}"
    - copy all files into arg string
    - create global log of all operations
    - test that panics during the file indexing process will trigger a revert of all prior operations
    - cut all files into arg string
